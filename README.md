RStudio desktop - email with all the packages and versions installed

foundation: xaringan slides

practical: rmarkdown on github. possibly sent an email with a file to participants



# networkAnalysis

Questions: Do we assume knowledge of R/Rstudio? 
Do we stick with RStudio? or RStudio Cloud? or Google Colab? 
Theory presentation: RMarkdown? Xaringan slides? 
Practical questions: separate document (e.g. RMarkdown?) ? include in the lecture slides?

**Time available**: 3 hrs over 2 days

**Packages to use**

## **day 1**: basics and applications (e.g. 

1.5hr - theory and some practical exercise
*Aim* to have 15 minutes of talking and activity

### Lesson plan

installing packages, loading files, housekeeping - repo

**15-20 minutes**
Introduction:
Why Social Network Analysis
Main application areas

**10 minutes**: group activity

15-20 minutes




introduction:
What is social network analysis and why do it. Example of application areas

Theory: Basics of social network graph: basic terms and concepts

Connectivity of a network based on measures of distance, reachability, and redundancy of paths between nodes

In the assignment, you will practice using NetworkX to compute measures of connectivity of a network of email communication among the employees of a mid-size manufacturing company.



1.5hr - practical exercise - creating and managing networks using igraph and statnet




day 2 - visualizations and advanced topics (this is where the question is how far to go and what can be completed within the first day)
