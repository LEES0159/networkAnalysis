## `ggraph` and `tidygraph` packages

While `igraph` and `statnet` packages are "classic" for working with networks, rather recent developments include `ggraph` and `tidygraph` packages:

-`ggraph` extension to ggplot2 for graph analysis

- `tidygraph` provides a way for `dplyr` to interact with graphs

let's start with `ggraph`....

### `ggraph` 

R is FANTASTIC, but when visualizing networks, it lacks .. as time and effort are required to produce "nice" graphs

```{r}
g_got<-read_graph("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/netViz/master/data/GoT/gotS1.graphml", format="graphml")

plot(g_got)
```
Does not look nice...

While in other visualization aspects R has a "winner" - `ggplot2` packages.

`ggraph` marries the `ggplot2` winning approach to the world of networks:

`ggraph`=`ggplot2 of networks`

We are also going to use `graphlayouts` package, which introduces additional useful layout algorithms to R. 

`ggraph` uses the same underlying principles of the grammar of graphics. So, if you are familiar with them, you can skip the next section!

**Grammar of graphics**: a framework which follows a layered approach to describe and construct visualizations or graphics in a structured manner. 

[This link](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html) provides a more in-depth explanation of the grammar of graphics

---------

Let's have a brief look at out graph: 

`autograph()`: quickly shows an overview of your network data. 
```{r}

autograph(g_got)
```

`ggraph` works with layers, where each layer adds a new feature to the plot and builds the final grapg step-by-step. 

```{r}
got_palette <- c("#1A5878", "#C44237", "#AD8941", "#E99093", "#50594B")

ggraph(g_got,layout = "stress")+
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_width = Weight),edge_colour = "grey66")+
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu,size = size),shape=21)+
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name),family="serif")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette)+
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2,3))+
  scale_size(range = c(1,6))+
  theme_graph()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Let's have a closer look:

**Layout**: calculates a layout. 

The `layout` parameter specifies the algorithm to use. The `stress` layout is part of the `graphlayouts` package. It produces nice layouts for almost any graph. 

```{r}
ggraph(g_got,layout = "stress")
```

To recollect: some other layout algorithms of igraph.
```{r eval=FALSE}
c("layout_with_dh", "layout_with_drl", "layout_with_fr", 
  "layout_with_gem", "layout_with_graphopt", "layout_with_kk", 
  "layout_with_lgl", "layout_with_mds", "layout_with_sugiyama",
  "layout_as_bipartite", "layout_as_star", "layout_as_tree")
```
To use them, you just need the last part of the name.
```{r eval=FALSE}
ggraph(routes_graph,layout = "dh")+
```

**Edges**: second layer specifies how to draw the edges

```{r eval=FALSE}
geom_edge_link0(aes(width = weight),edge_colour = "grey66")

```

Edges can be drawn in many different ways as the list below shows.

```{r eval=FALSE}
c("geom_edge_arc", "geom_edge_arc0", "geom_edge_arc2", "geom_edge_density", 
  "geom_edge_diagonal", "geom_edge_diagonal0", "geom_edge_diagonal2", 
  "geom_edge_elbow", "geom_edge_elbow0", "geom_edge_elbow2", "geom_edge_fan", 
  "geom_edge_fan0", "geom_edge_fan2", "geom_edge_hive", "geom_edge_hive0", 
  "geom_edge_hive2", "geom_edge_link", "geom_edge_link0", "geom_edge_link2", 
  "geom_edge_loop", "geom_edge_loop0")
```

HINT: for a standard network plot stick with `geom_edge_link0`: it draws a straight line between the endpoints.

With `geom_edge_link0`, the appearance of the edge can be specified by mapping edge attributes to aesthetics or setting them globally for the graph. 

Mapping attributes to aesthetics is done within `aes()`: 

- the edge width is mapped to the edge attribute `weight.` 

- the colour of all edges is set to `grey66.`

We can use the following aesthetics within `geom_edge_link0` either within `aes()` or globally:

- `edge_colour` (colour of the edge)

- `edge_width` (width of the edge)

- `edge_linetype` (linetype of the edge, defaults to “solid”)

- `edge_alpha` (opacity; a value between 0 and 1)

`ggraph` does not automatically plot arrows if your graph is directed: use `arrow` parameter.

```{r eval=FALSE}
geom_edge_link0(aes(...),..., 
                arrow = arrow(angle = 30, length = unit(0.15, "inches"),
                              ends = "last", type = "closed"))
```                              
                              
The default arrowhead type is “open”, but “closed” usually has a better appearance.

**Nodes**

```{r eval=FALSE}
geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size),shape = 21)+
geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name),family = "serif")
```
The `node` layer should always go above the `edge` layer. Otherwise, edges will be visible on top of nodes. There are slightly less geoms available for nodes.

c("geom_node_arc_bar", "geom_node_circle", "geom_node_label", 
"geom_node_point", "geom_node_text", "geom_node_tile", "geom_node_treemap")

The most used ones:

`geom_node_point()`: equivalent of `ggplot2::geom_point()` for simple plotting of nodes in different shapes, colours and sizes.


```{r}
gr <- create_notable('bull') %>%
  mutate(class = sample(letters[1:3], n(), replace = TRUE))

ggraph(gr, 'stress') + geom_node_point()
```

`geom_node_point()` option can set using `aes()` or globally:

- `alpha`: opacity; a value between 0 and 1

- `colour`: colour of shapes 0-20 and border colour for 21-25

- `fill`: fill colour for shapes 21-25

- `shape`: node shape; a value between 0 and 25

- size: size of node

- stroke: size of node border

Possible shapes for the nodes can include:

![Shapes for nodes](img/points-symbols.png)
*Shapes 1-20*: to change the color of shapes 1-20 use the `colour` option 

*Shapes 21-25*: use `fill.` 

`geom_node_text()`:  to add node labels. It is similar to `ggplot2::geom_text()` and `ggplot2::geom_label()`.

Options for `geom_node_text()`:

- `label`: attribute to be displayed as node label

- `colour`: text colour

- `family`: font to be used

- `size`: font size

The `filter` parameter allows you to specify a rule for when to apply the aesthetic mappings. This is most commonly used for node labels, but can also be used for edges or nodes. 

**Scales**

```{r eval=FALSE}
scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette)+
scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2,3))+
scale_size_continuous(range = c(1,6))

```

The `scale_*` functions: control aesthetics that are mapped within `aes()`.

Steps:

- map variables to aesthetics with `aes()`

- change appearances with `scale_` 

This layer can be skipped but generally you use `aes()` to map attributes for further use in the `scale_*` functions.

```{r}
ggraph(g_got,layout = "stress")+
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_width = Weight),edge_colour = "grey66")+
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu,size = size),shape = 21)+
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name),family="serif")+
  theme_graph()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```
To work out the variable type you can use the table below:


Aesthetic	| Variable type	|Description
---|---|---
node | size |	continuous	
edge |	width	|	continuous	
node colour/fill	|	categorical/continuous	|	use a gradient for continuous variables
edge colour	|	continuous	|	categorical only if there are different types of edges
node shape	|	categorical	|	only if there are a few categories (1-5). Colour should be the preferred choice
edge |	linetype	|	categorical	only if there are a few categories (1-5). Colour should be the preferred choice
node/edge alpha	|	continuous	

For `ggraph` colours are assigned in the order of the unique values of the categorical variable. They are usually set as `factors` or if it is a character, then sorting the unique values.

To have more control over colours you can use a vector with colours

```{r eval=FALSE}
got_palette2 <- c("5" = "#1A5878","3" = "#C44237","2" = "#AD8941",
                  "1" = "#E99093", "4" = "#50594B")
```

`scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette)`

To select colours you can use this [link](https://www.htmlcsscolor.com/)

Compare

```{r}
ggraph(g_got,layout = "stress")+
geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_width=Weight),
                edge_colour="grey66")+
geom_node_point(aes(fill=clu,size=size),
                shape=21,col="grey25")+
scale_edge_width_continuous(range=c(0.1,1.5))+
scale_size_continuous(range=c(1,8))+
theme_graph()+
theme(legend.position = "none")
```

and

```{r}
got_palette2 <- c("5" = "#1A5878","3" = "#C44237","2" = "#AD8941",
                  "1" = "#E99093", "4" = "#50594B")

ggraph(g_got,layout = "stress")+
geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_width=Weight),
                edge_colour="grey66")+
geom_node_point(aes(fill=clu,size=size),
                shape=21,col="grey25")+
scale_edge_width_continuous(range=c(0.1,1.5))+
scale_size_continuous(range=c(1,8))+
scale_fill_manual(values=got_palette2)+
theme_graph()+
theme(legend.position = "none")
```
For easy colour selection you can also use `scale_fill_brewer()` and `scale_colour_brewer()` from `ggplot2`. You can see the palettes they offer at [colorbrewer2.org](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) .

.
```{r}
ggraph(g_got,layout = "stress")+
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_width = Weight),edge_colour = "grey66")+
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu,size = size),shape = 21)+
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name),family = "serif")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues")+
  scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2,3))+
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1,6))+
  theme_graph()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

Some popular palettes include

Type | Palettes
---|---
Diverging | BrBG, PiYG, PRGn, PuOr, RdBu, RdGy, RdYlBu, RdYlGn, Spectral
Qualitative | Accent, Dark2, Paired, Pastel1, Pastel2, Set1, Set2, Set3
Sequential | Blues, BuGn, BuPu, GnBu, Greens, Greys, Oranges, OrRd, PuBu, PuBuGn, PuRd, Purples, RdPu, Reds, YlGn, YlGnBu, YlOrBr, YlOrRd


**themes**: control the overall look of the plot (e.g. axis, background, grids, etc.)

```{r eval=FALSE}
theme_graph()+
theme(legend.position = "none")
```

`theme_graph()`: remove the default `ggplot` theme

`theme(legend.position = "none")`: controls the legend. Possible options are "none", "left", "right", "bottom", "top", or two-element numeric vector.


```{r}
ggraph(g_got,layout = "stress")+
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_width = Weight),edge_colour = "grey66")+
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu,size = size),shape = 21)+
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name),family = "serif")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuBu")+
  scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2,3))+
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1,6))+
  theme_graph()+
  theme(legend.position = "right")

```
