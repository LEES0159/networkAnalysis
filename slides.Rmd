`statnet` package

['statnet'](http://statnet.org/) is a collection of R packages for 

- management, 

- exploration, 

- statistical analysis, 

- simulation and 

- vizualization of network data. 

The statistical modeling framework is based on [Exponential-family Random Graph Models (ERGMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_random_graph_models).

Questions to ask about a network:

- How large the network is?

- How densely connected is it? 

- Is the network made up of one or more distinct groups?

- How compact is the network?

- How clustered are the network members?
